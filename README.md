# sleep

Sleep is the single most important activity in life;
it restores our tired bodies 
and consolidates neural connections to help form/retain memories.
A good night's sleep 
can dramatically increase effectiveness 
in all areas of your life. 
Tracking your sleep times 
and reflecting on your sleep quality
can help you focus on this vital
aspect of health and longevity.


# Why?

If you don't get a good night's sleep
virtually everything about your next day
will be worse. 

See below for all the areas sleep affects.


# What?

This App is the simplest possible sleep tracker
(_other than using a paper notepad and pen 
or a note taking App on your phone ..._)

A deliberatly basic version of an App is
commonly referred to as Minimum Viable Product ("MVP")
which means it has the minimum features to be useful,
but leaves a lot enhancements out. 

If you think of a feature/improvement, _please_
[**open an issue**!](https://github.com/dwyl/sleep/issues)
Contributions/ideas are always welcome
and we're delighted to extend this
in response to feedback!

# Who? 

Everyone sleeps.


# When?

You can start using this MVP _now_ (_tonight_).

> If you're reading this past **22:00**,
go straight to the "***Try it!***" section
and treat yourself to an _early_ night!




# How?



## Try it!

Firstly, you can try the App via Heroku:
https://sleepdev.herokuapp.com

Try the following actions: 

+ **Log _in_**
+ **_Start_** a sleep timer
+ **Stop** the timer - to confirm that it works.
+ **Log _out_** - to confirm that no data is stored in the browser.
+ **Log _back in_** - with the same Google or GitHub account you used to login before.
+ ***Confirm*** your "sleep" session was recorded.


## Run it!

Now that you've tried it on Heroku,
if you want to dig deeper,
try running the _finished_ (MVP) on your computer.

Open a terminal window and run the following commands:

Clone the project to your computer:

```
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/sleep.git
```

Navigate to the **`sleep`** directory:

```
cd sleep
```


Install the dependencies:

```
mix deps.get
```

# Research

We have read several books on sleep (_so you don't have to_).


## Why Focus on Sleep?

If you aren't sleeping enough
you will not be able to function.
